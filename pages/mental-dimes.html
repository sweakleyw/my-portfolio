                Mental Dimes was a Sports Blogging website that needed a
                complete overhaul. <br /><br />We decided on a simple layout
                that is blog friendly and feature the articles by the date they
                were written. After consulting with the owner, he chose to use
                the Canard theme through WordPress, and we enhanced it to work
                for our blog. With the articles being the primary source piece
                of content, the emphasis needed to be on them. The layout
                provides a summary of each article, along with the ability to
                attach an image to the article. The design allows us the
                capability to easily categorize the articles by sport, making it
                easy for the readers to find what they are looking for.
                <br /><br />We chose a multiple column layout to highlight the
                most popular articles along side the most recent articles. We
                also incorporated the Twitter feed in the second column, since
                social media has become a strong force in getting eyes on
                content, and Twitter is arguably the top social media platform
                for Mental Dimes. <br /><br />For the footer, it is important
                for the readers to be able to subscribe to the weekly
                newsletter, so we put the option to subscribe in the footer.
                There is a pop-up, but just in case some people miss the pop-up
                the form is in the footer. <br /><br />The typography was chosen
                with legibility in mind. Playfair Display is used for the
                headlines of each article. The font works perfectly for
                headlines and teeters on the boundaries of being a modern font.
                The body type is PT Serif, which is a popular magazine/blog body
                font that is easy to read. <br /><br />The color palette was
                chosen by the owner. He is a fan of a couple of sports teams
                whose main color is orange. From there we decided black would be
                a good color to go with it, and with keeping the colors simple
                to ensure everything is easy to read we chose black and orange.
                <br /><br />The company is no longer around.
