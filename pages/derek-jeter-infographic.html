              <p class="info">
                Derek Jeter became a Hall of Fame baseball player, due to his
                successful career. <br /><br />
                The challenge of the graphic was to create an infographic that
                is easy to digest, while highlighting his awards and statistics
                over the course of his career that got him to the Hall of Fame.
                <br /><br />The focus was to highlight his awards as
                illustrations and his statistics with different graphs. The
                illustrations help to drive the point of how many awards he
                actually won, while the graphs show how great his hit record and
                other statistics were. <br /><br />The colors, pinstripes, and
                number 2 are elements he was associated with over his career.
                While the white silhouette is of him celebrating his last
                walk-off RBI of his career.
